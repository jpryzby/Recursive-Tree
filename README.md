A recursive graphic program that draws a tree. It was made using the python turtle package

This program uses a recursive function breanch() which draws a line, then calls itself 5 times. For each recursive call, it passes down a set of variables that determine the length, thickness, angle, location, and recursive depth. 

When a certain recursive depth is reached, a base case is called, which draws a leaf and terminates.
